# constellations.el

## Commentary:

`constellations.el` provides a constellation abbreviation lookup tool. I can
never remember the abbreviations for most constellations so, when I was
writing my observing logs (http://www.astronomer.me.uk/logs/) I found this
little tool handy -- saved me from having to remember.

The latest `constellations.el` is always available from:

## TODO:

All sorts of extra stuff could be added. The first obvious tool would be a
method of going the other way (abbreviation to name).
